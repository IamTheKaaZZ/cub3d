# Cub3D

The main goal of this this project is to create a raycaster using techniques inspired by `Wolfenstein 3D`.<br>
âœ… Final grade: 105/100<br>
(Old project completed in May 2021, project details were changed in July 2021)

## Objective

In this 42 project we are asked to extract information from a .cub file and use that to draw a 3D perspective of a 2D maze on the screen using raycasting principles.

Example of a valid cub file's information:
```
R 1920 1080

NO ./textures/greystone.xpm
SO ./textures/purplestone.xpm
WE ./textures/redbrick.xpm
EA ./textures/wood.xpm

S ./textures/sprite.xpm
F 77,92,53
C 163,208,230

This project had several challenges

    > Finding the right way to extract the cub information.
    > Parsing the .cub file correctly.
    > Using and understanding the minilibx drawing tool.
    > Understanding raycasting and the DDA algorithm.
    > Creating the bmp screenshot file.
